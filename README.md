# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
This repository consists of a famous [Kaggle Competetion Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) for prediction of survival on the Titanic and getting familiar with ML basics.  
It contains following files:  
* 'Titanic Survival Prediction.ipynb : Our notebook with scripts in which I did Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Feature Transformation, Hyperparameter Tuning, Model Comparision, Model Evaluation etc. 
* `train.csv` : Training set
* `test.csv` : Testing set without 'Survived' feature. (for the purpose of predicting by our own)
* `my_submission.csv` : our prediction on test set
